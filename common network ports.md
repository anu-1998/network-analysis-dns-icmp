# 🔌 Common Network Ports and Services

Understanding common ports and protocols is essential for cybersecurity analysis, incident response, and network monitoring.  
This guide lists the most frequently used ports, their protocols, and their associated services.

## 🌐 What Are Ports?
Ports identify which **network service or application** data should go to.  
For example:
- Port **80** = HTTP (web traffic)
- Port **53** = DNS (domain name resolution)
- Port **22** = SSH (secure remote access)
